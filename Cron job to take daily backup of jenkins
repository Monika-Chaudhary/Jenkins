Instead of plugin thinbackup we will go with cron job


cat > /path/jenkinsBackupScript.sh
todayDate=$(date +"%d-%m-%Y") //If want to take daily backup with date wise
mkdir -P /path/to/folder/FullBackup
cp -rf /pathToJenkinsHome/.jenkins/* /path/to/folder/FullBackup

Give execute permission: chmod +x jenkinsBackupScript.sh

Details of crontab:
will display current user's cron jobs > crontab -l
will display cron config file for current user's cron jobs > crontab -e
will delete current user's cron jobs > crontab -r


Edit file to create cron job to take daily backup everyday at 10 pm > crontab -e
0 22 * * * /path/jenkinsBackupScript.sh

See cron file > crontab -l
