Pre-requisite:
1. Save Java version installed on both master and slave machine

Over master:-
1. Generate ssh keys over /home/jenkins/.ssh (jenkins user)
> ssh-keygen
Name of key - slave1436

Over slave:-
1. Add jenkins user
> sudo useradd jenkins

2. Give password to this user
> sudo passwd jenkins
Enter password now like devOps@123

3. Copy public key content from master server key and paste over slave jenkinsHomeUser [/home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys]

4. Create slaveDir anywhere where we have some space. Suppose create inside /apps then /apps/slaveJenkins96b7/

5. Add Java on this slave dir by adding jvm dir
/apps/slaveJenkins96b7/jvm/bin/java

Over Jenkins:-
1. Go to jenkins -> manage jenkins -> manage credentials -> scope-system -> global credentials -> 
ID - rememberName like machineNameMaster
Description - machineNameMaster
Username - jenkins (userToConnect)
Check - treat username as secret
Private key - enter private key from master server



2. Go to jenkins -> manage jenkins -> manage nodes and clouds -> click on '+ New Node' button

Name - machineNameSlave
Type - permanent agent
Click on Create 

Give description 
No. Of executors : 2 or required no.
Root directory: /apps/slaveJenkins96b7
Labels : slave1436
Usage : use this node as much as possible 
Launch method: launch agent agents via ssh
Host : machineIp (take slave Ip - hostname -i)
Add credentials of public one
Host key verification strategy: non verifying verification strategy 
Availability: keep this agent online as much as possible 
Click on Save

3. Go to this node and launch agent

Troubleshooting: 

1. If any Java problem coming then check Java version which must be same as master Java version 

Take required Java package and send over slave machine by SCP command
 > scp -r /apps/slaveJenkins96b7/jdk jenkins@slaveMachineIp:/apps/slaveJenkins96b7/

(Prompt for password so give password of jenkins user)


[scp -r sourceJavePath username@slaveMachineIp:destinationPath ]

2. If any space issue then see free space using command 
> df -h
 Then change direction to that directory which has more free space 

On Jenkins node-> go to created node and configuration -> change 
Root directory: /apps/slaveJenkins96b7 to /another/freeSpaceDir/path
